# HaskellPractice
* All the Haskell Practices I have attempted from 2009 to 2020(coming soon). I haven't finished all of them, but I will find a time to fill the gaps.
* I recommend everyone who is interested in building a compiler to attempt some of them as they are related to some topics of how to build a compiler. (e.g. Finite State Automata)
